        "WHO": "Who I am",
        "TEXT1": "As far as I can remember, I have always drawn, ever since I was a child. I filled sheets and sheets of drawings, copied my favorite characters or created new ones.",
        "TEXT2": "I've never stopped, even though I've done other in my life: scientific studies and work in the IT world. I have always loved drawing by pencil and charcoal, portraying everyone and I have often experimented with colors and pastels.",
        "TEXT3": "During my university studies I attended a naturalistic watercolor illustration course and I studied the techniques of painting and drawing, especially of human figure, as a self-taught. Always curious, eager to learn and improve, sensitive to nature and its beauty.",
        "TEXT4": "Few years ago I discovered digital drawing by experimenting and always looking for new solutions to improve my style. Currently interested in children's illustration, I have a project in progress that I hope will become the first of many others.",
        "TEXT5": "In my spare time I play saxophone, ukulele and enjoy studying modern piano. I think that art in all its forms allows us to express creativity in the world and helps to abandon the rationality that life often imposes on us, getting closer to our \"feeling\""
