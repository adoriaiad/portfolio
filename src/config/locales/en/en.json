  "BIO": {
    "WHO": "Who I am",
    "TEXT1": "As far as I can remember, I have always drawn, ever since I was a child. I used to fill sheets and sheets of drawings, copy my favorite characters, or create new ones.",
    "TEXT2": "I've never stopped drawing, even though I've done other things in my life: scientific studies and work in the IT field. I have always loved drawing by pencil and charcoal, portraying everyone and I have often experimented new pieces with colors and pastels.",
    "TEXT3": "During my university studies, I attended a course of naturalistic watercolor illustration, and I studied the techniques of painting and drawing, especially human figures, as a self-taught. Always curious, eager to learn and improve, sensitive to nature and its beauty.",
    "TEXT4": "A few years ago, I discovered the digital drawing technique by experiencing and always looking for new solutions to improve my style. Currently interested in children's illustration, I am developing a project that I hope will become the first of many others.",
    "TEXT5": "In my spare time I play saxophone, ukulele and enjoy studying modern piano. I think that the art, in all its forms, allows us to express creativity through the world and helps to abandon rationality that life often imposes on us, getting closer to our \"feelings\"."
